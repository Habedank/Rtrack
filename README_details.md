(NOTEs indicate only that the installed size is 5.2 Mb due to the embedded strategy calling models. This is a bit larger than the 5 Mb package size limit preferred by CRAN. However, having the models embedded in the package simplifies installation.)

## R dependencies
Imports: 	crayon, graphics, grDevices, Hmisc, KernSmooth, methods, openxlsx, parallel, pbapply, randomForest, RCurl, readxl, rjson, scales, stats, stringi, terra, tools, utils, zip

Suggests: 	knitr, rmarkdown

## Hardware requirements
No special hardware is required.

# 2. Installation guide
`install.packages("Rtrack")`
Install time is typically < 30 s depending on internet connection speed and the number of dependencies the user already has installed.

# 3. Demo
The core functionality can be demonstrated by the following code which downloads an example dataset, processes track metrics, calls strategies and draws a strategy overview plot.
```
experiment = Rtrack::read_experiment("https://rupertoverall.net/Rtrack/examples/MWM_example.trackxf")
strategies = Rtrack::call_strategy(experiment)
Rtrack::plot_strategies(strategies, experiment, factor = "Strain")
```
This code takes 14 s to complete on an M1 MacBook Pro laptop (using only a single CPU core and including download time).
A detailed walk-through of all functions provided by the package is also available at https://rupertoverall.net/Rtrack/articles/Rtrack_tutorials_page.html

# 4. Instructions for use
The online tutorials https://rupertoverall.net/Rtrack/articles/Rtrack_tutorials_page.html provide step-by-step instructions for running the software and details on how to prepare raw data for analysis.
